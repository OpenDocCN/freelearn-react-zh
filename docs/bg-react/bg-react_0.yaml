- en: Projects like Angular and React are rapidly changing how development teams build
    and deploy web applications to production. In this book, you'll learn the basics
    you need to get up and running with React and tackle real-world projects and challenges.
    The book includes helpful guidance on how to consider key user requirements within
    the development process, and also shows you how to work with advanced concepts
    such as state management, data-binding, routing, and the popular component markup
    that is JSX. As you complete the included examples you'll find yourself well-equipped
    to move onto a real-world personal or professional frontend project.

- en: If you are a frontend developer who wants to create truly reactive user interfaces
    in JavaScript, then this the book for you. For React, you'll need a solid foundation
    in the essentials of the JavaScript language, including new OOP features that
    were introduced in ES2015\. An understanding of HTML and CSS is assumed, and a
    basic knowledge of Node.js will be useful in the context of managing a development
    workflow, but is not essential.

    UI Design*, introduces React and helps us to start building the basic infrastructure
    of a React-based application. Then, we will analyze how to design a user interface
    so that it can be easily mapped to React components.'
